I imagine experimental physicists must often look with envy at men
like Kamerlingh Onnes, who discovered a field like low temperature,
which seems to be bottomless and in which one can go down and
down. Such a man is then a leader and has some temporary monopoly in a
scientific adventure. Percy Bridgman, in designing a way to obtain
higher pressures, opened up another new field and was able to move
into it and to lead us all along. The development of ever higher
vacuum was a continuing development of the same kind.
