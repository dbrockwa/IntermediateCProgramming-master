If we consider that part of the theory of relativity which may
nowadays in a sense be regarded as bona fide scientific knowledge, we
note two aspects which have a major bearing on this theory. The whole
development of the theory turns on the question of whether there are
physically preferred states of motion in Nature (physical relativity
problem). Also, concepts and distinctions are only admissible to the
extent that observable facts can be assigned to them without ambiguity
(stipulation that concepts and distinctions should have meaning). This
postulate, pertaining to epistemology, proves to be of fundamental
importance.
